This coursework provides an overview of derivative pricing models and various approaches used in modeling option prices on financial markets. It covers key concepts and mathematical methods employed in pricing European options, such as the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo method, and binomial models, along with their limitations and advantages. Examples of the application of each method include options on stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange (Sberbank, Lukoil) and NASDAQ (Apple, Amazon). It is demonstrated in practice that the models converge to the same prices.
